# Jay String Quartet

A young and talented (and entirely imaginary) string quartet is trying to make a name for itself, in particular for performances of late nineteenth and early twentieth century music. While the world of classical music still operates within established practices of conservatoires, patronage, prizes, and concert recitals, a world with which the quartet readily engages, it realises that it is helpful to have a website to better describe what it does and what makes it different, and to give out information to make it easier for cultural organisers and events organisers to find out about it and get in touch with it. Its repertoire is too limited for it to be able to do many private or corporate functions. It has a new recording, which is important as much as a calling card as for generating income from sales. A website serves this purpose for functionality but also for wide accessibility (considering the possible wide age range of the audience). It is necessary for the audience to be able access the site on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

NOTE: Although I use photos of a real quartet and other musicians, the Jay String Quartet and its members are totally fictitious. All names apart from one (my nephew Charlie Seaborn) are invented (actually based on the names of film directors and actors) as are many of the other details about festivals, conservatoires, prizes, etc. Video links are to a variety of quartets

# UX

## User stories
1. As a first time visitor
* I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be reassured that I have found a site which may have what I am looking for
* I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content
* I want to find meaningful content, for instance, relevant information about the quartet, music and videos, information about concerts
* If need be, I want to be able to contact the quartet for whatever the level of my enquiry (potential booking, media story, information about the music, fan letter, etc)
* If I am interested, I would like to be able to access the quartet’s social media

2. As a returning visitor, I want to
* find, having already found that the site is relevant and has meaningful content, up to date information and news
* find new music to buy, stream, or sample

3. As a concert and events organiser or manager, I want to
* have access to biographical information
* access press and publicity material
* be able to contact the quartet easily

4. As a journalist, music writer, or other, I want to
* have access to biographical information
* access to press and publicity material
* be able to contact the quartet easily
* to see the latest news and releases

5. As a member of the public who is or is potentially interested in seeing them in concert or buying or listening to their music, I want to
* find out when concerts are and be able to book tickets
* listen to their music
* buy or stream their music, or be directed to sites that buy or stream it
* have access to biographical and other information

## Strategy (user needs and business objectives)
1. A website with a professional feel will help the quartet to stand out in a competitive world It is unlikely in and of itself to lead to many bookings or sales. It is, rather, to establish a professional presence.
* It has had some critical success and has a new album, and wants to become better known
  *General information, bios, recordings, videos, reviews
* It may apply for philanthropic funding – so it needs to look impressive for a potential donor
  * General information, bios, recordings, videos, plus information about outreach
* It wants to get bookings for quality concerts and festivals
  * Bios, press material, videos and recordings, reviews, contact details and contact form
* It has a new recording that it wants to publicise
  * Links to purchase (Presto) or stream (Spotify etc)
* It runs an annual festival that it would like to promote
  * A section on the festival
* It is involved in outreach to schools
  * Brief information about schools activities

2. The user stories above don’t envisage any age demographic, but visitors are likely to be people generally interested in culture and the arts, who would appreciate a serious tone to the site. 
* People who are interested in them already, who’ve heard them at concerts and requested recordings, or who’ve read reviews
  * Photos and videos, news, recordings, upcoming concerts
* People hoping to buy or stream music
  * Link to Presto Classical, Alpha, Spotify, Deezer, Soundcloud
* Concert venue managers, festival organisers, etc
  * Contact details and contact form, bios, videos and recordings, reviews
* Potential donors from philanthropic foundations or private individuals
  * Information to make the quartet stand out as worthy of funding

## Scope (functional specifications and context requirements)
1. As a start, the quartet needs simply to establish a presence as an up and coming quartet. Therefore the website requires
* Group story and bios
* Photos as a group and in concert
* Samples of music
* Upcoming events
* Videos

2. Its recording functions as a calling card for promotors, events organisers, etc
* Sample of recording
* Critical reviews
* Upcoming events
* A contact form

3. Aspects to save till later:
* A press pack should come in the next iteration
* Information about outreach or community activities are not a priority – just some brief notes
* Additional pictures, videos, sound samples, which can be introduced as they become available and as need arises – don’t devote resources now

## Structure (interaction and information design)
1. The site has a simple structure, one layer deep. Users may arrive on the home page, from which they navigate via the navigation bar to the other pages. Any pages can be equally navigated to from any other page. It might have been appropriate to create many pages, each dealing with a specific topic, so that no one page feels overloaded. This is beyond the scope of this project.
2. Home
* Image
* Critical acclaim
* New album
* Videos

3. About
* History of the quartet
* Individual bios or other similar info

4. Calendar & news
* Festival
* Upcoming performances

5. Contact
* Contact from
* Contact details

## Skeleton (interface, navigation, and information design)
1. Wireframe mock-ups were developed on [Figma]( https://www.figma.com/file/5dnnWm7NgyfR9LtBAZmiMF/File_JSQ_m?node-id=20%3A3)
* It will be seen that the planned site on Figma bears little relation to the final site. The plan had been to immerse the viewer in the visual world of impressionist painting that would complement the music. However, this plan did not survive long when coding began.
* I rapidly saw that such an approach looked 20 years out of date, and was not pleasant to read. In addition, pictures were distorted and shortcomings in the quality of the images became apparent.
* Other details, such as using musical notation on the contact form, proved to look messy when implemented. Perhaps for a later iteration!
* So I preferred to use just the one image to give the colour and feel, and keep the rest of the site as clean as possible.
* The basic site – Home – About – Calendar – Contact remained the same, but page layouts were changed as it became apparent that information could not be clearly and comfortably presented as it was. So I modified design to three horizontal bands on each page (two on the contact page). The user would be comfortable moving about a more consistent site, and pages would be more understandable. It was also possible to present more information this way without cluttering the pages.

* See wireframe at [Figma]( https://www.figma.com/file/5dnnWm7NgyfR9LtBAZmiMF/File_JSQ_m?node-id=20%3A3)

2. Colour scheme and imagery
* The images and colours are taken from the paintings of the Spanish impressionist painter Joaquín Sorolla, so that the site is imbued with an impressionist and painterly air to match the quartet’s interest in painting and in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The particular pictures chosen suggest the outdoors, freshness, summer, etc. Colours of fonts and navigation and other elements were selected from the paintings themselves, to provide harmony and balance.
* I chose the name Jay since it’s a fairly colourful and characterful bird. A simple picture (by Esther Van Hulsen, from [Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/esthervanhulsen/art/European-Jay-716536046) is used as a logo to add a little colour and novelty.

3. Photographs
* The photographs are of the [Omer Quartet](https://www.omerquartet.com/), which I had never heard of before but which has plenty of photos on its site. In exchange I’ve signed up to its email list and will buy an album when it releases one. Other photos are variously sourced. The picture of Beakfield Barns festival centre is in fact of [Wingfield Barns](https://www.wingfieldbarns.com/) in Suffolk.

4. Fonts
* Two variable Google Fonts were chosen, with an unfussy late nineteenth & early twentieth  century feel, Rosario for headings and Catamaran for other text. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.

## Surface (visual design)
1. The header includes the quartet’s logo – a jay, containing the home page link. On larger screens there is a navigation bar, and on smaller screens a toggler icon leading to the navigation 

2. On all screen sizes the footer contains social media and music player icons. The bright colour acts as a pleasant closure of the page.

3. The Home page is presented as relatively uncluttered. There is a friendly but serious quartet image (hero image doesn’t seem quite the right phrase) that takes up a little over half a desktop screen, with empty space either side, and the full width of a mobile screen. Underneath the image is an album cover image with options to stream or buy it, and underneath that four embedded videos.

4. The challenge with the About page is that it could easily become very wordy. People like to know how string quartets got together, what their approach to music is, and what are the careers of the individual musicians. As with the Home page, the main image is a little over half the screen of a desktop, and the full width of a mobile. A more complex site could make use of accordions to enable information to be displayed and concealed. A lively picture of the quartet is chosen.

5. The Calendar page is straightforward and a mainstay of similar sites. To give it more prominence, I have chosen to highlight the festival first, with a simple picture, and then the list of concerts, with a neutral violin playing image

6. The Contact us page is very simple, with just the picture of the lead violinist. Underneath, for the sake of colour and for a bit or energy is some news of a future event. The picture is of children on the beach at Valencia – which gives a pleasant lively sense and even (to me at least) some mild associations of racing to catch or contact someone.

## Further testing
1. For desktop and laptop, the website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari browsers on desktop
2. For mobile phones, the website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera on Android and iPhones. I note that GitHub would not load on Firefox on an Android.
3. Links were extensively checked and layout examined
4. Friends and family were asked to comment on the site

## Known bugs
1. Since the wireframe was not successful, I didn’t have a good enough overall structure of the site. This meant that a repeated process was required as bugs became apparent, were fixed, and became elsewhere. This meant a process of re-reading Bootstrap and course notes, checking on StackOverflow and W3Schools etc, seeking tutor support, returning to sources for help, etc. I wouldn’t recommend this as a way to work but it’s been a good learning experience. I say this because I suspect that while the code generally works, to a practised eye it would look bodged up – no point avoiding the problem in the README!

# Credits
## Code
1. Bootstrap was used for the navigation bar, including jQuery
2. The code for the calendar is taken from that of [Simone Kermes](https://simone-kermes.de/calendar /) - I don't know if it's an efficient way to do this, but it is interesting to learn about this option (giving the information first in rows and then in a table for the different screen sizes), and I like the very clean result.
3. The contact form is from Bootstrap
4. Videos – additional css from https://flaviocopes.com/ 
5. I benefitted greatly from closely looking at other students’ work, which my mentor shared with me
* The milestone project of Miranda Thewlis, https://mkthewlis.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/index.html,
* The README from the milestone project of Rebecca Tracey-Timoney, https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/KryanLive

## Content
1. Extensive use was made of the websites of string quartets. 
* I have taken photos from the [Omer Quartet](https://www.omerquartet.com/), which I’d not heard of before.
