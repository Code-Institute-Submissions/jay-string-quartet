# Jay String Quartet #

A young and talented (and entirely imaginary) string quartet is trying to make a name for itself, in particular for performances of late nineteenth and early twentieth century music. While the world of classical music still operates within established practices of conservatoires, patronage, prizes, and concert recitals, a world with which the quartet readily engages, it realises that it is helpful to have a website to better describe what it does and what makes it different, and to give out information to make it easier for cultural organisers and events organisers to find out about it and get in touch with it. Its repertoire is too limited for it to be able to do many private or corporate functions. It has a new recording, which is important as much as a calling card as for generating income from sales. A website serves this purpose for functionality but also for wide accessibility (considering the possible age range etc of audience). It is necessary for the audience to be able access the site on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Strategy (user needs and business objectives) ##

1   A website with a professional feel will help the quartet to stand out im a competitive world It is unlikely in and of itself to lead to many bookings or sales. It is, rather, to establish a professional presence. 
*   It has had some critical success and won a few prizes, and wants to become better known
    *   General information, bios, recordings, videos, reviews
*   It may apply for philanthropic funding – so it needs to look impressive for a potential donor
    *   General information, bios, recordings, videos, plus information about outreach
*   It wants to get bookings for quality concerts and festivals
    *   Bios, press material, videos and recordings, reviews, contact details and contact form
*   They like to work on creative collaborations
    *   Examples of  collaborations, contact details and contact form
*   It has a new recording that it wants to publicise
    *   Links to purchase (Presto) or stream (Qobuz, etc)
*   It runs an annual festival that it would like to promote
    *   A page on the festival
*   It is involved in outreach to schools

## Scope (functional specifications and context requirements) ##




This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
