# Jay String Quartet

A young and talented (and entirely imaginary) string quartet is trying to make a name for itself, in particular for performances of late nineteenth and early twentieth century music. While the world of classical music still operates within established practices of conservatoires, patronage, prizes, and concert recitals, a world with which the quartet readily engages, it realises that it is helpful to have a website to better describe what it does and what makes it different, and to give out information to make it easier for cultural organisers and events organisers to find out about it and get in touch with it. Its repertoire is too limited for it to be able to do many private or corporate functions. It has a new recording, which is important as much as a calling card as for generating income from sales. A website serves this purpose for functionality but also for wide accessibility (considering the possible wide age range of the audience). It is necessary for the audience to be able access the site on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

NOTE: Although I use photos of a real quartet and other musicians, the Jay String Quartet and its members are totally fictitious. All names apart from one (my nephew Charlie Seaborn) are invented (actually based on the names of film directors and actors) as are many of the other details about festivals, conservatoires, prizes, etc. Video links are to a variety of quartets

# UX

## User stories
1. As a first time visitor
* I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be reassured that I have found a site which may have what I am looking for
* I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content
* I want to find meaningful content, for instance, relevant information about the quartet, music and videos, information about concerts
* If need be, I want to be able to contact the quartet for whatever the level of my enquiry (potential booking, media story, information about the music, fan letter, etc)
* If I am interested, I would like to be able to access the quartet’s social media

2. As a returning visitor, I want to
* find, having already found that the site is relevant and has meaningful content, up to date information and news
* find new music to buy, stream, or sample

3. As a concert and events organiser or manager, I want to
* have access to biographical information
* access press and publicity material
* be able to contact the quartet easily

4. As a journalist, music writer, or other, I want to
* have access to biographical information
* access to press and publicity material
* be able to contact the quartet easily
* to see the latest news and releases

5. As a member of the public who is or is potentially interested in seeing them in concert or buying or listening to their music, I want to
* find out when concerts are and be able to book tickets
* listen to their music
* buy or stream their music, or be directed to sites that buy or stream it
* have access to biographical and other information

## Strategy (user needs and business objectives)
1. A website with a professional feel will help the quartet to stand out in a competitive world It is unlikely in and of itself to lead to many bookings or sales. It is, rather, to establish a professional presence.
* It has had some critical success and has a new album, and wants to become better known
  *General information, bios, recordings, videos, reviews
* It may apply for philanthropic funding – so it needs to look impressive for a potential donor
  * General information, bios, recordings, videos, plus information about outreach
* It wants to get bookings for quality concerts and festivals
  * Bios, press material, videos and recordings, reviews, contact details and contact form
* It has a new recording that it wants to publicise
  * Links to purchase (Presto) or stream (Spotify etc)
* It runs an annual festival that it would like to promote
  * A section on the festival
* It is involved in outreach to schools
  * Brief information about schools activities

2. The user stories above don’t envisage any age demographic, but visitors are likely to be people generally interested in culture and the arts, who would appreciate a serious tone to the site. 
* People who are interested in them already, who’ve heard them at concerts and requested recordings, or who’ve read reviews
  * Photos and videos, news, recordings, upcoming concerts
* People hoping to buy or stream music
  * Link to Presto Classical, Alpha, Spotify, Deezer, Soundcloud
* Concert venue managers, festival organisers, etc
  * Contact details and contact form, bios, videos and recordings, reviews
* Potential donors from philanthropic foundations or private individuals
  * Information to make the quartet stand out as worthy of funding

## Scope (functional specifications and context requirements)
1. As a start, the quartet needs simply to establish a presence as an up and coming quartet. Therefore the website requires
* Group story and bios
* Photos as a group and in concert
* Samples of music
* Upcoming events
* Videos

2. Its recording functions as a calling card for promotors, events organisers, etc
* Sample of recording
* Critical reviews
* Upcoming events
* A contact form

3. Aspects to save till later:
* A press pack should come in the next iteration
* Information about outreach or community activities are not a priority – just some brief notes
* Additional pictures, videos, sound samples, which can be introduced as they become available and as need arises – don’t devote resources now

## Structure (interaction and information design)
1. The site has a simple structure, one layer deep. Users may arrive on the home page, from which they navigate via the navigation bar to the other pages. Any pages can be equally navigated to from any other page. It might have been appropriate to create many pages, each dealing with a specific topic, so that no one page feels overloaded. This is beyond the scope of this project.
2. Home
* Image
* Critical acclaim
* New album
* Videos

3. About
* History of the quartet
* Individual bios or other similar info

4. Calendar & news
* Festival
* Upcoming performances

5. Contact
* Contact from
* Contact details

## Skeleton (interface, navigation, and information design)
1. Wireframe mock-ups were developed on Figma
* It will be seen that the planned site on Figma bears little relation to the final site. The plan had been to immerse the viewer in the visual world of impressionist painting that would complement the music. However, this plan did not survive long when coding began.
* I rapidly saw that such an approach looked 20 years out of date, and was not pleasant to read. In addition, pictures were distorted and shortcomings in the quality of the images became apparent.
* Other details, such as using musical notation on the contact form, proved to look messy when implemented. Perhaps for a later iteration!
* So I preferred to use just the one image to give the colour and feel, and keep the rest of the site as clean as possible.
* The basic site – Home – About – Calendar – Contact remained the same, but page layouts were changed as it became apparent that information could not be clearly and comfortably presented as it was. So I modified design to three horizontal bands on each page (two on the contact page). The user would be comfortable moving about a more consistent site, and pages would be more understandable. It was also possible to present more information this way without cluttering the pages.

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
